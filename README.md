## What we shall do next

- CSS formatting for the about us page
- Contact form to be centered
- Contact page intro text, let's rewrite that a bit
- Build the events "landing" page to show off the events in style
- Homepage events list to be restricted to perhaps 4 at a time
- Homepage events list to filter out events that are now in the past
- The next thing will be the business pages
- Things to do in Farnboough
- A v1 of Gatsby is going to be released soon and we shall upgrade when the time is right to do so
- ~~Footer to be added from old site~~

### Day to day running of Farnborough Guide

- Hunt around for event information, chat with local businesses and organisations who are planning to run/host an event

### Events

For more details on how to add events please read the dedicated README file under the pages/events folder

### Future plans for this site (one step at a time)

Once we have events nailed we shall move on to the next set of modules for the site

- Businesses


## Other things, considerations and ideas

### Considerations

- Should be easy to upload images such as events posters we want to publish on the site as we currently do
- Services we can use
  - Instagram
  - Cloudinary
  - Dropbox

### Graphcool

- There is talk of there being a package for this on Gatsby but short of that I will investigate how to integrate

### Serverless

- stdlib
- serverless
- webtask 



### Webhooks

- Trigger builds when
  - New image is uploaded?
  - Always when code is pushed to master on GitHub

### Hosting 

- Netlify
