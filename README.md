## Events

- How are we going to handle events in this application? Present the options we have as a whole
- Create a folder under pages called "events" and in here we add files that represent each of our events based on .md files


## How shall we store our images

### Considerations

- Should be easy to upload images such as events posters we want to publish on the site as we currently do
- Services we can use
  - Instagram
  - Cloudinary
  - Dropbox

## Graphcool

- There is talk of there being a package for this on Gatsby but short of that I will investigate how to integrate

## Serverless

- stdlib
- serverless
- webtask 



## Webhooks

- Trigger builds when
  - New image is uploaded?
  - Always when code is pushed to master on GitHub

## Hosting 

- Netlify
