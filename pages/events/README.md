Adding an event is easy and the rest is automatic now.

Steps to take

- Add a new folder under "events"
- Then you will need to create a new file within the new folder called index.md 
- To the top of that file you add a standard frontmatter and in fact you can copy one from an existing event and edit it, that way it's more foolproof
- You also need at least one image in the new folder that acts as our poster

The title can be anything and spaces are fine

The type field matters and should be set to event, as that is how the homepage lists the latest events

Image is used in all indexes across the site, so we only need to have one copy of each image on the site under each event folder

Date matters too because we can exclude events that have been and gone, we can also sort events in order of whats next
