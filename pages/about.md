# Whats in the Name?
Farnborough was mentioned in the domesday book of 1086, a Saxon settlement. The name Farnborough is derived from "Ferneberga" believed to mean "Fern Hill". There are many links to this ancient name across the town. In fact our office is in the old Town Hall, Ferneberga House.

Farnborough has established itself firmly as being the home of aviation and the history behind it.

 

# Aircraft and Aviation
Over the years Farnborough has played a major role in the British aviation industry and is linked with three particular milestones in the history of the industry that has ultimately led to faster travel across the globe.

Farnborough was the location where the first ever powered flight was made, thanks to the American businessman and showman, Samuel Cody. A monument was erected in his memory outside the FAST Museum which includes a permanent exhibit dedicated to his name, the Samuel Cody Pavilion.

During the Second World War, the jet engine was tested at Farnborough before it went into production to aid the war effort. Frank Whittle just like Cody became a well known name across the town. Frank Whittle also has a memorial erected in his memory, the slightly unconventional roundabout of the same name!

Farnborough played a big part in the story of Concorde, which was seen as the aircraft of the future back in 1970 when it made it's debut at the Farnborough International Airshow. It made a regular appearance at the show over the years, appearing for the very last time in 2000 before being decommissioned from our skies for good.

 

# The Future...
Farnborough is a town that has always been in a state of transition mainly due to the industry here and it's location with excellent connections to London, Guildford, Basingstoke and Southampton. So it is no surprise that it continues to be attractive to investors in business and property.

We at Farnborough Guide hope to shed some light on what you may expect to see in Farnborough in the future. No doubt the biennial International Airshow will continue to thrive and draw business to the area. We are also seeing a rise in technology companies choosing to base themselves here. It is an attractive location for small companies with fantastic communities such as North Camp who embrace the entrepreneurial spirit of many.
